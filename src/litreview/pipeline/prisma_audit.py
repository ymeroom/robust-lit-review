"""PRISMA 2020 self-audit and manuscript repair system.

Checks each of the 27 PRISMA items against the actual manuscript content,
identifies gaps, and generates targeted fix instructions for writing agents.

Usage in the pipeline:
1. After all sections are written, run audit()
2. If gaps found, dispatch repair agents for specific sections
3. Re-audit until all items pass
4. Generate the final checklist with pass/fail status
